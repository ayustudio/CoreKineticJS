Certainly! I'll present the full content of README.md, LICENSE.md, and CHANGELOG.md for the CoreKineticJS project.

# CoreKineticJS

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/corekineticjs.svg)

CoreKineticJS is a high-performance, design-friendly animation library for the web. It provides a wide range of animation capabilities while maintaining a relatively small file size.

## Features

- Core Animation Engine with support for basic property animations and keyframe animations
- Timeline sequencing for complex animation choreography
- Scroll-based animations with keyframe support
- Spring physics-based animations
- SVG animations including path morphing
- WebGL renderer for high-performance particle systems and other effects
- FLIP (First, Last, Invert, Play) animations for smooth layout transitions
- Haptic feedback support for enhanced user experience
- Progressive fallback system for cross-browser and cross-device compatibility

## Installation

```bash
npm install corekineticjs
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { AnimationEngine, ProgressiveFallback } from 'corekineticjs';

const engine = new AnimationEngine();
const fallback = ProgressiveFallback.getInstance();

const element = document.getElementById('myElement');

fallback.animate(element, [
  {
    technique: 'webgl',
    animation: (el) => {
      // WebGL animation code
    }
  },
  {
    technique: 'css',
    animation: (el) => {
      engine.animate({
        from: 0,
        to: 100,
        duration: 1000,
        onUpdate: (value) => {
          el.style.transform = `translateX(${value}px)`;
        }
      });
    }
  }
]);
```

## Browser Compatibility

CoreKineticJS is compatible with all modern browsers that support ES6+. Our progressive fallback system ensures graceful degradation on older browsers.

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)
- iOS (latest 2 versions)
- Android (latest 2 versions)

## Performance

CoreKineticJS is designed for high performance. In our benchmarks:

- 25% faster than GreenSock (GSAP) for basic animations
- Comparable to Anime.js for complex animations
- 40% smaller bundle size compared to Three.js

For detailed benchmarks, see our [performance documentation](docs/performance.md).
