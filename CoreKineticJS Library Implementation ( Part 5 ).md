## AnimationEngine

The `AnimationEngine` is the core class for creating and managing animations.

### Methods

#### `animate(options: AnimationOptions): Animation`

Creates a new animation with the given options.

Parameters:
- `options: AnimationOptions` - Configuration for the animation

Returns:
- `Animation` - The created animation object

Example:
```javascript
const engine = new AnimationEngine();
engine.animate({
  from: 0,
  to: 100,
  duration: 1000,
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
  onUpdate: (value) => {
    element.style.opacity = value / 100;
  }
});
```

## Easing

The `Easing` object provides various easing functions for animations.

### Available Easing Functions

- `linear`
- `easeInQuad`
- `easeOutQuad`
- `easeInOutQuad`
- `easeInCubic`
- `easeOutCubic`
- `easeInOutCubic`
- `easeInQuart`
- `easeOutQuart`
- `easeInOutQuart`

Example:
```javascript
import { Easing } from 'corekineticjs';

const progress = Easing.easeInOutQuad(0.5); // Returns the eased value at 50% progress
```

## Timeline

The `Timeline` class allows for sequencing multiple animations.

### Methods

#### `add(options: AnimationOptions, startTime: number): this`

Adds an animation to the timeline.

Parameters:
- `options: AnimationOptions` - Configuration for the animation
- `startTime: number` - The time at which the animation should start (in milliseconds)

Returns:
- `this` - The Timeline instance for chaining

#### `play(): void`

Starts playing the timeline.

Example:
```javascript
const timeline = new Timeline();
timeline.add({
  from: 0,
  to: 100,
  duration: 1000,
  onUpdate: (value) => {
    element1.style.opacity = value / 100;
  }
}, 0)
.add({
  from: 0,
  to: 200,
  duration: 1000,
  onUpdate: (value) => {
    element2.style.transform = `translateX(${value}px)`;
  }
}, 500);

timeline.play();
```

## ProgressiveFallback

The `ProgressiveFallback` class provides functionality for creating animations with graceful degradation across different browsers and devices.

### Methods

#### `static getInstance(): ProgressiveFallback`

Returns the singleton instance of the ProgressiveFallback class.

#### `animate(element: HTMLElement, options: FallbackOption[]): void`

Animates the given element using the most efficient supported technique from the provided options.

Parameters:
- `element: HTMLElement` - The element to animate
- `options: FallbackOption[]` - An array of animation options for different techniques

Example:
```javascript
const fallback = ProgressiveFallback.getInstance();

fallback.animate(element, [
  {
    technique: 'webgl',
    animation: (el) => {
      // WebGL animation code
    }
  },
  {
    technique: 'css',
    animation: (el) => {
      el.style.transition = 'transform 1s ease-in-out';
      el.style.transform = 'translateX(100px)';
    }
  }
]);
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

Q: What makes CoreKineticJS different from other animation libraries?
A: CoreKineticJS stands out with its ProgressiveFallback system, integrated haptic feedback, and flexible rendering options (WebGL, Canvas, CSS, JS) all in one package. It's designed to provide high-performance animations with graceful degradation across different browsers and devices.

Q: Is CoreKineticJS free to use in commercial projects?
A: Yes, CoreKineticJS is released under the MIT license and is free to use in both personal and commercial projects.

Q: How does CoreKineticJS compare to GreenSock (GSAP) or Anime.js?
A: While GSAP and Anime.js are excellent libraries, CoreKineticJS offers a unique combination of features. It's generally faster for basic animations, comparable for complex animations, and offers additional features like haptic feedback and progressive fallbacks that aren't typically found in other animation libraries.

## Technical

Q: How do I integrate CoreKineticJS with React/Vue/Angular?
A: CoreKineticJS can be easily integrated with any framework. We provide framework-specific adapters for React, Vue, and Angular that make integration seamless. Check our documentation for detailed integration guides.

Q: Can I use CoreKineticJS for game development?
A: While CoreKineticJS is primarily designed for web animations, its WebGL capabilities make it suitable for simple 2D games. For complex 3D games, a specialized game engine might be more appropriate.

Q: Does CoreKineticJS support server-side rendering (SSR)?
A: CoreKineticJS is primarily a client-side library. While you can use it in SSR environments, the animations themselves will only run on the client side.

## Performance

Q: How does CoreKineticJS perform on mobile devices?
A: CoreKineticJS is optimized for mobile performance. The ProgressiveFallback system ensures smooth animations even on less powerful devices by automatically choosing the most efficient animation technique.

Q: Is there a performance penalty for using the ProgressiveFallback system?
A: The performance impact of ProgressiveFallback is minimal. The initial technique selection adds a negligible overhead, which is outweighed by the performance benefits of using the most efficient animation method for each device.

Q: How can I optimize animations for best performance?
A: Use the ProgressiveFallback system, prefer CSS animations for simple transformations, use WebGL for complex particle systems, and always test on various devices. Our documentation provides more detailed performance optimization tips.

## Features

Q: Can CoreKineticJS animate SVG elements?
A: Yes, CoreKineticJS includes an SVGAnimation module that can animate SVG elements, including path morphing.

Q: Does CoreKineticJS support physics-based animations?
A: Yes, CoreKineticJS includes a PhysicsSimulation module for creating physics-based animations.

Q: Can I create scroll-based animations with CoreKineticJS?
A: Absolutely! The ScrollAnimation module in CoreKineticJS is specifically designed for creating scroll-based animations.
