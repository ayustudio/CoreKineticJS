# Known Issues

As of version 1.0.0, the following minor issues are known in CoreKineticJS:

1. Type safety warnings in ScrollAnimation plugin:
   - The `updateElement` method in `src/plugins/ScrollAnimation.ts` uses `any` type when setting style properties. This may lead to less strict type checking for style properties.

2. Type safety warning in LottieAnimation plugin:
   - The `load` method in `src/plugins/LottieAnimation.ts` uses `any` type for the `animationData` parameter. This may provide less type information for users of the library when working with Lottie animations.

3. Limited browser compatibility testing:
   - While efforts have been made to ensure broad compatibility, extensive testing across all browser versions has not yet been completed.

4. Performance benchmarking:
   - Comprehensive performance benchmarking across various devices and scenarios is still in progress.

5. WebGL fallback:
   - In scenarios where WebGL is not supported, the fallback mechanism may not provide identical visual results in all cases.

These issues do not significantly impact the functionality of the library and will be addressed in future updates. If you encounter any problems related to these issues, please report them on our GitHub issues page.

# Future Improvements

The CoreKineticJS team is committed to continuously improving the library. Here are some of the enhancements we're planning for future releases:

1. Enhanced Type Safety:
   - Improve type definitions in ScrollAnimation and LottieAnimation plugins to eliminate use of `any` types.
   - Implement stricter type checking across the entire codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Conduct and publish comprehensive performance benchmarks.
   - Optimize animation calculations for improved performance, especially on mobile devices.

3. Expanded Browser and Device Support:
   - Increase test coverage across a wider range of browsers and devices.
   - Implement more sophisticated progressive enhancement techniques.

4. Advanced Animation Features:
   - Introduce more complex easing functions and animation patterns.
   - Develop a visual timeline editor for creating and managing complex animation sequences.

5. Enhanced WebGL Capabilities:
   - Expand WebGL renderer to support more advanced 3D animations and effects.
   - Improve WebGL fallback mechanisms for better consistency across different rendering methods.

6. Improved Documentation and Examples:
   - Create interactive documentation with live code editors.
   - Develop a comprehensive set of examples showcasing advanced usage scenarios.

7. Plugin Ecosystem:
   - Develop a plugin system to allow for easy extension of CoreKineticJS.
   - Create a marketplace or repository for community-contributed plugins.

8. Framework Integrations:
   - Deepen integration with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
   - Develop specific wrappers or components for seamless use within these frameworks.

9. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Implement features to make animations more accessible, including respecting reduced motion preferences.
   - Provide guidelines and tools for creating accessible animations.

10. Build and Bundle Optimizations:
    - Implement tree-shaking to allow users to include only the features they need.
    - Explore ways to further reduce the library's file size without compromising functionality.

We welcome community input on these planned improvements. If you have suggestions or would like to contribute to any of these efforts, please visit our GitHub repository or join our community discussions.
