# Future Improvements

The CoreKineticJS team is committed to continuously improving the library. Here are some of the enhancements we're planning for future releases:

1. Enhanced Type Safety:
   - Improve type definitions in ScrollAnimation and LottieAnimation plugins to eliminate use of `any` types.
   - Implement stricter type checking across the entire codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Conduct and publish comprehensive performance benchmarks.
   - Optimize animation calculations for improved performance, especially on mobile devices.

3. Expanded Browser and Device Support:
   - Increase test coverage across a wider range of browsers and devices.
   - Implement more sophisticated progressive enhancement techniques.

4. Advanced Animation Features:
   - Introduce more complex easing functions and animation patterns.
   - Develop a visual timeline editor for creating and managing complex animation sequences.

5. Enhanced WebGL Capabilities:
   - Expand WebGL renderer to support more advanced 3D animations and effects.
   - Improve WebGL fallback mechanisms for better consistency across different rendering methods.

6. Improved Documentation and Examples:
   - Create interactive documentation with live code editors.
   - Develop a comprehensive set of examples showcasing advanced usage scenarios.

7. Plugin Ecosystem:
   - Develop a plugin system to allow for easy extension of CoreKineticJS.
   - Create a marketplace or repository for community-contributed plugins.

8. Framework Integrations:
   - Deepen integration with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
   - Develop specific wrappers or components for seamless use within these frameworks.

9. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Implement features to make animations more accessible, including respecting reduced motion preferences.
   - Provide guidelines and tools for creating accessible animations.

10. Build and Bundle Optimizations:
    - Implement tree-shaking to allow users to include only the features they need.
    - Explore ways to further reduce the library's file size without compromising functionality.

We welcome community input on these planned improvements. If you have suggestions or would like to contribute to any of these efforts, please visit our GitHub repository or join our community discussions.
